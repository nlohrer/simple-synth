# simple-synth
Simple synth using Python to create basic sine, square, sawtooth or square waves. examples.py includes some examples for creating such waves and for basic additive synthesis.

To create .wav files for sine waves via command line, you can use "python sine.py [frequency] [length] [filename]"

For example, "python sine.py 440 5 a.wav" creates a 5 second long sine wave pitched at A440.
